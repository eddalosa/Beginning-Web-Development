		<h2>Shooting and Editing Videos</h2>
		<p class = "intro">This is kinda a blog post about my journey learning to shoot and edit videos. I remember failing a multimedia course in my second year of university because I didn't complete the project which required us to make a multimedia file that demonstrated the concepts of audio, videos etc. I ended up making a game which didn't actually reach the threshold that the lecturer required. Recently an opportunity to learn video shooting and editing came up. I took up the chance to learn and so far its been a great learning experience for me.So am just gonna describe my learning experience until now</P>
